            <p>
                I implemented an AI-driven Snake Game using Deep Reinforcement Learning, where an agent learns optimal strategies for movement and survival. The model leverages Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and reinforcement learning techniques to make intelligent decisions based on game state inputs. By training the AI on reward-based reinforcement, it adapts to maximize its score while avoiding obstacles and self-collisions.
                <br><br>
                Using PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, and NumPy, the model learns through experience replay and a Q-learning approach, optimizing performance over time. The training process involves reward shaping, penalizing negative moves while reinforcing positive actions, leading to gradual improvement in gameplay strategy.
                <br><br>
                This project explores the application of reinforcement learning in game environments, demonstrating the power of AI in learning complex strategies without predefined rules.

Leveraging the BIGNEWSALGN dataset, our tool classifies biases (left, lean left, center, lean right, right) and provides detailed explanations, combating echo chambers in today's information landscape. Users can input queries, articles, or URLs, processed through techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and web scraping. Despite computational challenges, our fine-tuned Gemma 7b model achieved 54.50% accuracy for 5-label classification and 67.50% for 3-label classification (left, center, right).

                Our project, "Gastro-intestinal Disease Prediction," aims to develop a non-invasive, image-based machine learning tool to classify GI diseases. Utilizing models like VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNet, and EfficientNet, we analyze endoscopic images from the KVASIR dataset. Our models reduce the need for invasive procedures, enhancing diagnosis accuracy and accessibility. Each model demonstrates unique strengths, with misclassifications primarily occurring between visually similar classes. Our approach promises to improve healthcare efficiency by supporting faster, more accurate GI disease diagnoses, ultimately benefiting patient care. Future work will focus on optimizing model performance and exploring ensemble methods.
